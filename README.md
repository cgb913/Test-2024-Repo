Hi I'm Colton Burkhart currently I am a student and research assistant at Stonehill College. Specifically I am studying multimodal coordination of social learning in Guppies. Upon graduation (2026) I would like to begin a phD program focused in evolutionary genetics. Located in the Portfolio repository you can find some of my work in R studio, While I am still a beginner I throughly enjoy programming and I'm looking forward to using my programming skills for data analytics of my research as well as learning new code languages.
